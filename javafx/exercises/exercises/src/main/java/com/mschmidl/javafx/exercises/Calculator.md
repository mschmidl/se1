# Calculator example

Final goal is to create a JavaFX Calculator

### Step 1:

Use the following classes to create the layout for a calculator:
 - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html
 - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/layout/GridPane.html
 - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Button.html

Desired result: See "keyboard layout.jpg"

### Step 2:

Make the number inputs do something.
Create a variable to store the current number being put in. Every time a new number is pressed multiply the current number by ten and add the new number.
